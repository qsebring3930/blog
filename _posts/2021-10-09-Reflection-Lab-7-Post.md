My Razor Pages github repository can be found [here](https://github.com/qsebring3930/csci340lab7).

#What were the easiest parts of the tutorial?
Downloading visual studio and the .NET SDK and creating the Razor Pages template. After that everything went downhill.
#What were confusing parts of the tutorial?
The part of the tutorial that talked about adding id validation didn't work for me, it was supposed to return a 404 page but it just loaded a white page instead when there was a wrong id entered in the url. The tutorial then said to just remove it since users aren't expected to use the url to navigate, so I left it behind but I'm still curious as to what went wrong there.
#What was difficult to translate when creating your own application in Step 2?
The tutorial was pretty straight forward, the only difference I encountered was data annotations for my database. I wish there were more types built in.
#What parallels and differences do you see between the Jekyll framework and the Razor framework?
Both frameworks have most of the same functionalities like running a local server, handling multiple pages and their redirects, and abstracting website design with templates. However, Razor Pages doesn't have the markdown buffer between the programmer and the html code of the website, which I think makes it a bit more advanced/less beginner user-friendly. Razor pages also attaches C code to the html files.
#How confident do you feel making another Razor application?
pretty.
