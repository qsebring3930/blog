# What parts were new to me?
Understanding the structure of jekyll, how it uses documents and how to edit them. It actually made me pretty nervous trying to figure some of the language out because I was unfamiliar with it, I thought I was going to break something since jekyll is a terminal program and end up like [this guy](https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/117216).

# What parts did I struggle with?
I struggled with adding a link to the header, because of reasons stated previously. I took a very complicated [route](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-redirect-from) to putting a link in the header before realizing from a peer that it wasn't as complicated as I thought it was and I moved past it.

# What parts still do not make sense?
I've gotten pretty familiar with jekyll so far and I'm confident that I understand what was done in lab 4.

# What am I looking forward to?
I'm looking forward to my web page looking more like a myspace page, in the realms of this image but modern:
