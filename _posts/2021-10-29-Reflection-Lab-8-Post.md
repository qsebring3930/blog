# What were the easiest parts of the tutorial?
Just about everything was easy, it was just very time consuming.

# What were confusing parts of the tutorial?
Implementing Age for the student was probably the most confusing part of the tutorial; It didn't have integer examples for sorting or really any other step, so it took some thinking to figure out what was actually going on to write my own code, but it wasn't that hard.

# What was difficult about working with multiple tables as opposed to the single table in the previous lab?

The volume of pages that needed to be updated with every small change, I kept thinking "oh, this has got to be the end of this step" and then there were more and more pages that needed changes. The dependencies between tables is so much more tedious to deal with than one table.

# How prepared do you feel to create your team project now for your client, and what will be different for your situation?
I feel okay about transferring what I learned in this lab to the team project, however the main difference between this lab and our team is the sheer size of the databases we are working with. I'm prepared to learn how to adapt paging and concurrency solutions from the lab for our database in order to keep the website user-friendly in terms of speed.
