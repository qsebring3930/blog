# What parts were new to me?
1. Markdown
2. Running a local server through my terminal

What I'm currently writing with is new to me and I'm learning Markdown as I write this Markdown file. Also, running a local server of a webpage is new to me. I'm excited to finally have reached this point because I've always had this lingering thought about servers and local hosting and just never knew how to do it until now.

# What parts did I struggle with?
I struggled hard with getting ruby to install correctly and have my shell use it as the default when installing jekyll. However, I got past it by using all of the tools provided by rvm.

# What parts still do not make sense?
I'm still not exactly sure which port jekyll is using on my machine yet, because port 4000 isn't loading my webpage locally. However, I'm about to find that out right now.

# What am I looking forward to?
Actually using this webpage as a professional landing page for me. I'm probably gonna do a lot more to this page than is needed because, honestly speaking, what stem person doesn't have a big ego.
