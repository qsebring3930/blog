# My personal role in the team project so far
So far my role in the team has been mostly to do with organizational tasks like creating the schema for our database and organizing a Trello board for our use cases and user stories.

# My contribution to the second client meeting
I pushed for the excel document being the master database to be dropped in favor of an SQL database and it succeeded. I also updated the Schema with the information from the second client meeting, however past that I wasn't there for the second client meeting so I wasn't able to contribute much from what our client told my teammates.

# My future plans to assist my team in completing this project.
I need to update our Trello board with tasks that build on top of our use cases and user stories with proper timeframes and priority flags. I also plan to create the SQL database from the excel database we were given and guide my teammates on how to properly implement the database and its dependencies into our new website.
